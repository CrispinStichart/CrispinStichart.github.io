# About Me

Hello, and welcome to my personal ~~geocities~~ website! My name is Crispin Stichart, which, yes, is quite the unusual name. As far as I am aware, I am the only Crispin Stichart on this entire planet.

Here's a quick rundown on me:

* I don't update this wobsite very often
* I've been told that I look like:
  * the kind of person who would drive a Subaru (I thought about it, but ended up buying a RAV4)
  * the kind of person who would bake bananna bread (I do, I love the stuff)
  * Joaquin Phoenix (I do not)
* I like cats
  * I do not like dogs unless they are fluffy and friendly
* I am a software developer
  * worked for a defense contractor for a bit over two years after graduating, writing software for nuclear submarines
    * it was far less cool than it sounds
  * after having a midlife crises and quiting during COVID, I ended up tutoring computer science online for about a year and a half
    * if you hear someone mention that they're thinking of attending DeVry, DO NOT LET THEM
  * currently (since September 2024) working as a software developer for the Fairbanks North Star Borough ("borough" being what Alaska calls counties)    
* I remodeled a log cabin with no prior experience in construction
  * I am very proud of the floating staircase I built
* I like to read
  * If you're looking for a good book, may I suggest *The Devourers* by Indra Das
* I try my hand at writing fiction sometimes, but I've never finished anything
* I have a nice camera and, very occasionally, take some nice photos
  * I have also made some videos! They're weird and probably not as funny as I think they are. However, [an 8-second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP21UWLEJxE) I uploaded back in 2018 now has over 8K views, so that's some kind of validation I guess.


# Photos

I take photos sometimes. You can see my full gallery [on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/93091610@N03/), and here's a few I particularly like. As you can see, I don't have a particular style or niche.
