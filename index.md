# About Me

Hello, and welcome to my personal ~~geocities~~ website! My name is Crispin Stichart, which, yes, is quite the unusual name. As far as I am aware, I am the only Crispin Stichart on this entire planet. 

Here's a quick rundown on me:

* I like cats 
  * I do not like dogs unless they are fluffy and friendly
* I am a software developer
* I recently remodeled a log cabin with no prior experience in construction
  * I am very proud of the floating staircase I built
* I love reading (fiction)
  * If you're looking for a good book, may I suggest *The Devourers* by Indra Das
* I eat oatmeal every day
* I like writing but it's haaaaaaaaaaaard so I don't do it much
* I have a nice camera and, very occasionally, take some nice photos
  * I have also made some videos! :D (They are bad :( )

# My Resume (Recruiters please read this pretty please)

If you're here because I linked this website on my resume, then feast your eyes:

I have two and a half years writing software for nuclear submarines, which sounds way cooler than it actually was.

I wore many hats, and was involved in:

* Devops
  * Docker
  * Jenkins
  * a lot of custom glue in bash/python
* backend
  * Java
  * Python
* some frontend
  * a small amount of Python/PyGTK
  * JavaFX
* Linux-related sysadmin work
  * created custom Linux distributions
  * wrote an insane amount of bash scripts

I quit that job about two years ago, and have not worked in the industry since. I quit because I was trying to find the meaning of life. Luckily, I found it! Now I'm back in the coding game and looking to put my skills to use. 

I've also done a few projects over the years that I'm kind of proud of:

* [Format text into custom shapes](https://kingcritter.github.io/TextFormatterJavascript/index.html)
  * I could not find a single tool on the web to do this, so it *may* be a 100% original idea
  * Wrote this while in school, because there was a t-shirt design contest for the ACM chapter, and I thought it'd be neat to have a design that was a bunch of code formatted to look like the school mascot or logo. It didn't win. -_-
* [CHIP-8 Emulator](https://github.com/kingcritter/chip8_interpreter)
  * The first, and to date only, emulator I've ever written
  * Also the first and last significant amount of Rust code I've ever written
* [Mail Filter](https://github.com/CrispinStichart/imap_client) (*work in progress*)  
  *  Simple mail client intended to run 24/7 and send all incoming mail through whatever filters you define
  *  Started working on it after being unable to do what I wanted with Gmail's automatic filtering tools

I am also an Open Source Contributorâ„¢! (a [one-character fix](im-an-open-source-contributer/) is still a contribution, and I will die on this hill.) 

[onechar]: im-an-open-source-contributer/

Recruiters can stop reading now. :)

# Other Stuff

I take photos sometimes. You can see my full gallery [on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/93091610@N03/), and here's a few I particularly like. As you can see, I don't have a particular style or niche.

# Blog

Yeah, I have a blog. You probably saw the link up top. Reading a person's blog is the closest you'll ever get to reading their mind, so if you've ever wanted psychic powers I guess you gotta go click that link. 

<!-- I also have made some videos. Some are cringe  -->
