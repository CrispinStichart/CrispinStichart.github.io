# About Me

Hello, and welcome to my personal ~~geocities~~ website! My name is Crispin Stichart, which, yes, is quite the unusual name. As far as I am aware, I am the only Crispin Stichart on this entire planet.

Here's a quick rundown on me:

* I like cats
  * I do not like dogs unless they are fluffy and friendly
* I am a software developer
* I recently remodeled a log cabin with no prior experience in construction
  * I am very proud of the floating staircase I built
* I like to read
  * If you're looking for a good book, may I suggest *The Devourers* by Indra Das
* I try my hand at writing fiction sometimes, but I've never finished anything
* I have a nice camera and, very occasionally, take some nice photos
  * I have also made some videos! They're weird and probably not as funny as I think they are. However, [an 8-second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP21UWLEJxE) I uploaded back in 2018 now has, appropriately, over 8K views, so that's some kind of validation I guess.

Check out my [Projects](./projects) page for all the super awesome personal projects I've done.

# Photos

I take photos sometimes. You can see my full gallery [on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/93091610@N03/), and here's a few I particularly like. As you can see, I don't have a particular style or niche.

# Blog

Yeah, I have a blog. You probably saw the link up top. Reading a person's blog is the closest you'll ever get to reading their mind, so if you've ever wanted psychic powers I guess you gotta go click that link.

<!-- I also have made some videos. Some are cringe  -->
