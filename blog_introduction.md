# My Blog

Hello there, this is my blog. Every time I type the word "blog", I have to suppress the urge to call it a "blag" as a reference to that [one XKCD comic.](https://xkcd.com/148/) (See also [181](https://xkcd.com/181/), which also affected my vocabulary).

I don't write about any one thing in particular, and the things I do write aren't always written for a large audience; I like to write simply as a way of getting things out of my head.

Enjoy?
